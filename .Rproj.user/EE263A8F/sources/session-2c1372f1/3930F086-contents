The CRTs themselves require significant manipulation before one can begin any data analysis. The objective of this dataset is therefore to put the national inventories into a tidy, consistent format that better suits user needs. I sourced the original CRT files from the UNFCCC (e.g. https://unfccc.int/ghg-inventories-annex-i-parties/2024; https://unfccc.int/first-biennial-transparency-reports) and reformatted their summary reports into a single tidy, structured data table.",

The six main sectors are (1) Energy, (2) Industrial processes and product use, (3) Agriculture, (4) Land use, land-use change and forestry, (5) Waste, and (6) Other. A general description of the sectors is available in the TFI guidance. In this data file the first five high level sectors are split into 41 individual categories, which is the most detailed level of reporting provided in the CRT summary sheets. I have included only the data from 'leaf nodes' in the sector hierarchy, which are sectors that have no further child sectors. This means that you can safely sum up all sectors for each country without double counting. The higher level sector categories are provided as variables for convenient aggregation. The 'sector' tab of the spreadsheet shows which sectors are included and how they fit into the TFI hierarchy.",

More recent GWP100 values have been published in the IPCC AR6, but I have not yet figured out if it is possible to extract F-gases from every CRT in original units, which would be necessary to update the values.
