"0","                      ""This data file is a compilation of national greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) inventories, sourced from the Common Reporting Tables (CRTs) that countries submit to the UNFCCC. The CRTs themselves require significant manipulation before one can begin any data analysis. The objective of this dataset is therefore to put the national inventories into a tidy, consistent format that better suits user needs. I sourced the original CRT files from the UNFCCC (e.g. https://unfccc.int/ghg-inventories-annex-i-parties/2024; https://unfccc.int/first-biennial-transparency-reports) and reformatted their summary reports into a single tidy, structured data table."","
"0","                      ""Emissions are split into sectors as set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (TFI). The six main sectors are (1) Energy, (2) Industrial processes and product use, (3) Agriculture, (4) Land use, land-use change and forestry, (5) Waste, and (6) Other. A general description of the sectors is available in the TFI guidance. In this data file the five high level sectors are split into 41 individual categories, which is the most detailed level of reporting provided in the CRT summary sheets. I have included only 'leaf nodes' from the sector hierarchy in the file, which are sectors that have no further child sectors. This means that you can safely sum up all sectors for each country without double counting. The higher level sector categories are provided as variables for convenient aggregation. The 'sector' tab of the spreadsheet shows which sectors are included and how they fit into the TFI hierarchy."","
"0","                      ""Countries report emissions from CO2, CH4, N2O and F-gases (HFCs, PFCs, NF3, SF6). I have converted emissions from the different gases to CO2 equivalents using global warming potentials with a 100 year time horizon from the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (GWP100 AR5). More recent GWP100 values have been published in the IPCC AR6, but I have not yet figured out if it is possible to extract F-gases from every CRT in original units, which would be necessary to update the values. CH4 and N2O can be reconverted into their original units by dividing by 28 and 265, respectively."","
